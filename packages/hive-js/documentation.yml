      A reactive, "serverless" JavaScript framework.

      This is where the business logic exists in your codebase. The [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) is used as the basic building block to implement standardized, reactive microservices that employ the Actors. The intent is to clearly define a separation between infrastructure as code and business logic allowing them both to adapt and scale independently. From simple REST services to CQRS/ES microservices, this framework is flexible enough to enable the Actors to adopt new roles on the fly.

      *NOTE:* More examples can be found in the 2 example npm packages:
        - [hive-io-rest-example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hive-io-rest-example)
        - [hive-io-domain-example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hive-io-domain-example)

      The `Schema` [class](https://fnalabs.github.io/schema-json-js) exposed in this framework exists in a [different](https://www.npmjs.com/package/schema-json-js) [project](https://github.com/fnalabs/schema-json-js). It is a JSON Schema validator class that supports the `draft-04` and `draft-06` versions of the specification. It is used to enrich the `Model` with structured validation that is very flexible to evolve as your business needs do.
